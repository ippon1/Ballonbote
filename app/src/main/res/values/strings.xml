    <string name="helpText">Goal of the Game is to get as far as posible. The ballon is controlled by wiping a finger up and down or alternatively with tilting the device up and down.
        You have to deliver post by landing at the platform of each house. For landing you get a bonus. At each platform the level and game speed increases. If you crash into any obstacle or the ground you destroy your ballon.
        So you will lose your points since the last platform and have to repeat from there with one of your remaining ballons. Game over is when you have no remaining ballons.</string>
